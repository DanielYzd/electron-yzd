The server is identified by its host name and port number. \n * <li>Specifying options that relate to the communications link with the server, \n * for example the frequency of keep-alive heartbeats, and whether SSL/TLS is required.\n * <li>Subscribing to and receiving messages from MQTT Topics.\n * <li>Publishing messages to MQTT Topics.\n * </ol>\n * <p>\n * The API consists of two main objects:\n * <dl>\n * <dt><b>{@link Paho.MQTT.Client}</b></dt>\n * <dd>This contains methods that provide the functionality of the API,\n * including provision of callbacks that notify the application when a message\n * arrives from or is delivered to the messaging server,\n * or when the status of its connection to the messaging server changes.</dd>\n * <dt><b>{@link Paho.MQTT.Message}</b></dt>\n * <dd>This encapsulates the payload of the message along with various attributes\n * associated with its delivery, in particular the destination to which it has\n * been (or is about to be) sent.</dd>\n * </dl> \n * <p>\n * The programming interface validates parameters passed to it, and will throw\n * an Error containing an error message intended for developer use, if it detects\n * an error with any parameter.\n * <p>\n * Example:\n * \n * <code><pre>\nclient = new Paho.MQTT.Client(location.hostname, Number(location.port), \"clientId\");\nclient.onConnectionLost = onConnectionLost;\nclient.onMessageArrived = onMessageArrived;\nclient.connect({onSuccess:onConnect});\n\nfunction onConnect() {\n  // Once a connection has been made, make a subscription and send a message.\n  console.log(\"onConnect\");\n  client.subscribe(\"/World\");\n  message = new Paho.MQTT.Message(\"Hello\");\n  message.destinationName = \"/World\";\n  client.send(message); \n};\nfunction onConnectionLost(responseObject) {\n  if (responseObject.errorCode !== 0)\n\tconsole.log(\"onConnectionLost:\"+responseObject.errorMessage);\n};\nfunction onMessageArrived(message) {\n  console.log(\"onMessageArrived:\"+message.payloadString);\n  client.disconnect(); \n};\t\n * </pre></code>\n * @namespace Paho.MQTT \n */\n\nif (typeof Paho === \"undefined\") {\n\tvar Paho = {};\n}\n\n\nPaho.MQTT = (function (global) {\n\n\t// Private variables below, these are only visible inside the function closure\n\t// which is used to define the module. \n\n\tvar version = \"@VERSION@\";\n\tvar buildLevel = \"@BUILDLEVEL@\";\n\t\n\t/** \n\t * Unique message type identifiers, with associated\n\t * associated integer values.\n\t * @private \n\t */\n\tvar MESSAGE_TYPE = {\n\t\tCONNECT: 1, \n\t\tCONNACK: 2, \n\t\tPUBLISH: 3,\n\t\tPUBACK: 4,\n\t\tPUBREC: 5, \n\t\tPUBREL: 6,\n\t\tPUBCOMP: 7,\n\t\tSUBSCRIBE: 8,\n\t\tSUBACK: 9,\n\t\tUNSUBSCRIBE: 10,\n\t\tUNSUBACK: 11,\n\t\tPINGREQ: 12,\n\t\tPINGRESP: 13,\n\t\tDISCONNECT: 14\n\t};\n\t\n\t// Collection of utility methods used to simplify module code \n\t// and promote the DRY pattern.  \n\n\t/**\n\t * Validate an object's parameter names to ensure they \n\t * match a list of expected variables name for this option\n\t * type.
